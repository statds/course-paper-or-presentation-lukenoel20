# The Effects of the 2023 Rule Changes in Major League Baseball
Major League Baseball (MLB) is a sport continuously evolving through rule
changes dedicated to improving game dynamics, player safety, and fan engagement.
Prior to the start of the 2023 season, MLB's commissioner Rob Manfred
implemented a set of significant rule changes, headlined by the introduction of 
a pitch clock, defensive shift restrictions, and bigger bases. Although these
changes were intended to improve pace of play, action, and safety of the game,
their actual impact on various aspects of baseball performance and strategy is 
not well understood. By meticulously comparing the 2023 season data with preceding seasons, 
utilizing descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing, the study unveils significant
insights into the transformative effects of the 2023 MLB rule changes. The findings
offer valuable perspectives for the future landscape of baseball.
