\begin{abstract}
Major League Baseball (MLB) is a sport continuously evolving through rule
changes dedicated to improving game dynamics, player safety, and fan engagement.
Prior to the start of the 2023 season, MLB's commissioner Rob Manfred
implemented a set of significant rule changes, headlined by the introduction of 
a pitch clock, defensive shift restrictions, and bigger bases. Although these
changes were intended to improve pace of play, action, and safety of the game,
their actual impact on various aspects of baseball performance and strategy is 
not well understood. This study uses statistical methods to evaluate the effects
of the rule changes on game duration, scoring, hitting, pitching, fielding, and
baserunning. We compare the 2023 season data with the previous seasons using
descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis. INSERT
major findings here.
