\begin{abstract}
Major League Baseball (MLB) is a sport continuously evolving through rule
changes dedicated to improving game dynamics, player safety, and fan engagement.
Prior to the start of the 2023 season, MLB's commissioner Rob Manfred
implemented a set of significant rule changes, headlined by the introduction of 
a pitch clock, defensive shift restrictions, and bigger bases.
